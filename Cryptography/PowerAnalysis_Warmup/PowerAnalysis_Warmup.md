Description :
> This encryption algorithm leaks a "bit" of data every time it does a computation. Use this to figure out the encryption key.  
> Download the encryption program here `encrypt.py`. Access the running server with `nc saturn.picoctf.net xxxxx`.  
> The flag will be of the format picoCTF{`<encryption key>`} where <encryption key> is 32 lowercase hex characters comprising the 16-byte encryption key being used by the program.

Hints :
1. The "encryption" algorithm is simple and the correlation between the leakage and the key can be very easily modeled.
